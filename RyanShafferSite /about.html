      <h2>Academic background</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Marketing student at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a minor in Creative Technology & Design
        and a certificate in Global Business. My coursework focuses on understanding how brands communicate,
        how consumers make decisions, and how design influences perception.

      <h2>Creative interests</h2>
      <p>
        Im especially interested in projects that combine creativity with structure. I enjoy visual storytelling,
        layout and hierarchy, and exploring how small design decisions can change the way information is understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        I regularly work with tools like Adobe Creative Cloud and Figma, and I enjoy experimenting with new
        digital and AI assisted creative tools to push ideas further.

        music, live events, and the visual language surrounding them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Im also interested in travel, culture, and sustainability, and how global perspectives shape branding
        and business decisions.

      <h2>How I like to work</h2>
      <p>
        I learn best by building and iterating. I prefer to start with structure, test ideas quickly,
        and refine based on feedback and real world constraints.
