      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Many of the projects shown here began as class assignments and evolved into deeper
        explorations of how structure, design, and strategy work together. Im especially
        interested in how ideas are communicated clearly through layout, hierarchy, and storytelling.

        <h3>Digital design and experimentation</h3>
        <p>
          Creative experiments using digital tools, including layout studies, poster designs,
          and early stage web projects. These pieces often explore how small design choices
          affect usability and perception.

      <h2>Process and reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Across all of my work, I focus on process as much as outcome. I start by defining the
        problem, organizing information clearly, and iterating based on feedback. This approach
        helps me create work that is both intentional and adaptable.

      <p>
        This page will continue to grow as I complete new coursework and independent projects.
